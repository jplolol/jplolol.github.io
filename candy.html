                                Hi Simran!
I remember you being all 'gundi' sometime in primary, when our buses merged and you telling me "Mujhe bhook lagi hai toh mai khaaungi" with your eyes wide open👀 👀
Never really got to know you much during Drawing class but I guess MT had a role to play and our silly ex boyfriends too😂
It's been amazing to see how wonderful and strong you've become with time and it's good to know that 👀 hasn't changed yet😂
Wishing you a very happy lockdown 2.0 birthday❤️❤️
Love you😘

                                okay so Simran and I met back in 2019 and I thought of her as a super nice smart small delicate chick (I suck at first impressions I know) :) 
Cut to New Years where I saw her get sloshed and we had the best night ever!! Also that night we turned into puke buddies 💪🏻❤️ 
Around March, Dum Dum and I got close and that was the start of our endless rant sessions about how sad, single and bored we are 🤡
Here’s to vibing on all things sad, hyping eachother too much, bitching about everyone and everything and motivating eachother to be better ❤️ HAPPPY 20th saneeee I hope you have the best day and year(s) ahead love you!!❤️❤️❤️

how long have we come from a volumetric flask to me (🤡) bitching about every single person I know and pulling out stupid ass pranks on you lmaoooo bada maza aata hai meko🤣🤣🤣🤣. 
but on a serious note, i really would have been so lost without you, without you teaching me to love myself and not tolerating lesser than we deserve. I want to be like you, as resilient, unwavering and beautiful like you, and be able to stand upto whoso fkn ever. you have taught me innumerable things about my own self in the past years and I am THE ONE BLESSED TO share at least a part of my life with you. I hope you like me too? 💓💓💓
I am sorry for the times I am rude to others but u always put me in my place and thank for you that  (but please that fkn dumbass really is stupid) 🤮🤮
so to my fellow 1 number, Patrika lover and my future vansa I really love you a lot more than you know and even more than I can express. I am so happy to have you with me in our mini growth spurt journeys lmao (congratulations on your weight gain and I love your nose)

                                Dear Simran,
.
Happy Birthday - and welcome to your 20s! 
.
This past year, from the day you turned 19 you has just been... Wow.
I'm so proud of you for being so brave throughout it all. And I'm even prouder that even after all that's happened, you stayed you. ♡
You're a fighter, after all!
.
Despite the way it's been... I'm grateful for the way it's brought us closer. The way I know I can trust you, feel you. The nights where I stroll by my window,  listen to your voice over the phone, and know that... I'm not alone.
.
You're smart, caring, crazy, and so many things that make me go - This girl is f*cking amazing.  I hope that today reminds you that between all of the things you are, there's one thing you will never be - alone.
Because honey, you are never alone. We're all hoping for love someday, but I hope that along with that, you feel loved. We love you, stupid! 
.
.
.
Last year, I wrote to you to tell you that you're not weak. 
This year, let me rephrase that.
.
.
"You're a f*cking goddess."
.
A goddess who's earned her strength from enduring the things she's confided in me. She hasn't let the world change her, she believes in the best in people, and now - she believes in herself and knows who the f*ck she is!
.
.
So what's missing?
.
I think all that's left is a dream.
You've seen the world through your eyes, and as you begin the third decade of your life, halfway through college... It's time to decide what kind of future you want to live. 
Forget adulting.
Forget responsibilities.
Who do you want to be?
.
As I write this, part of me wants to see you to know. I want to meet you, share a warm beverage with you, watch the way your eyes sparkle as you talk about  your dreams - because I'm sure that like you... Your future's going to be f*cking amazing.
I really believe that. And whenever you feel like it doesn't, I'm always a call away. ♡
.
So before I end this letter so that you don't lose any more time on this precious day, a toast -
. 
Here's to the past, for the making us stronger.
Here's to dreams, for giving us hope.
And above it all, here's to the girl who's going to conquer it all. :")
.
Can't wait to hear from you, and hope we can catch up soon! ♡

Sending you love,
Kaustubh

P.S. Drinking game - take a shot every time Kaustubh says "f*cking" in this letter. 😂

                                Hello Love, 
     Might seem just awkward to you, but I've always been wanting to express myself about the love that I hold for you in my heart, heavy and pure.
     So it started when we first met, you were soo pretty back then, (which you still are) I remeber your long pale face, white snowing skin, Ah! beautiful times. I cant recall if it was 5th or 6th std when you sat a bench ahead of me, always resonating the aura that you would carry. I remember when I first saw your face, how madly I went crazy for you. All day & nights dreaming about you. 
     I hope you remeber, I used to make Lagna Patrika for you with random people mostly Omkar's name in it, and your smile when you opened that, still in my mind, FRESH. I never dared to write my name in it, although I made one kept it with myself and then in the trash, you know how much I longed for you. 
     But now is the time to open it up, enough of masti with JP, (although I love her, but yes I can ditch her just for your pretty face, she ain't pretty like you) now it's time to confess all my thoughts,  I love you Simran ❤
     So yes that's what something Abhishek wanted to write but I ended up with it. Anyways pretty, Happy 20th Birthday, you may relax now, this is all just timepass, just wanted to make you smile and relive the memories. JP asked me to write something for you, so I joked why not a Love letter, and here it is! 
     Anyway if at all the letter worked do reply, imma waiting. I'm all open :p

                                I honestly don’t know where sould I even start from. Okay, so shuru se shuru karte hai. 
                                First impression toh pata nahi, bilkul hi yaad nahi hai 11 saal pehle jo mile the.
                                 But yeah, I remember you being this shaant susheel bachi with no personality, who had an organized 
                                 compass box(itni daat padi hai mujhe iske vajah se), pencils with your name engraved on them, and 
                                 it obviously annoyed me A LOT. But eventually we became best friends kyuki aur koi choice hi nahi tha, 
                                 I mean that is what ends up happening when two people are put in the same school, same tuitions, 
                                 same drawing class, same building friends and idk what not! More than anyone I would like to thank 
                                 Prathibha Sane, if she wouldn’t have forced my mom to teach you, kuch bhi nahi hota life me.
                                  First of all you would’ve been dumb xP, second of all you wouldn’t have found an amazing person like me lolol. 
                                  Jokes apart, I mean seriously issi baat ki toh kushi hai hume life me ki boyfriend nahi hai toh bhi kya hi pharak padta hai we atleast have each other. 
                                  Bro as Kat says you’re literally 100% of my social life. We are so weird, we literally force each other to watch a show that the other person is watching so that we can “discuss” about it lmao. Also, the fact that I am able to write this without googling “how to wish a friend on his/her birthday without making it awkward” says a lot. Ye toh chod bro my DD literally said and I quote “give my regards to Simran, she sounds like a lovely person” that too in the 1st session, this just says how you’re a part of almost everything(even if you’re not related to it) in my life. I mean even now, we are in two different uni’s, that too in two different states lmao and somehow stuti is my friend and rushil, ananya(who is
                                 not even my friend anymore) and pratyush(how can we forget him) are yours. I hope ye letter bhi, mere “my letter to my future self” waale letter, ya ek This Is Us ke episode se kam nahi tha. Anyway, that you were forcing me a lot, aaj bol hi deti hu, I Love you bro. 
                                 I literally don’t know what I would do without, SO PLEASE DON’T DIE(atleast don’t die before me, no actually die before me I wanna live more)

                                First impression probably was wow she is pretty. 2nd,3rd and every other impression after that has just been 'what an absolute weirdo'.
                             But it's nice to have someone balance out your own sea cucumber or Bonobo facts weirdness so all of it works out.
                              You're very much an amazing BRO. Happy birthday and have a blast !
